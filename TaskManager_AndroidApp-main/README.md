# Overview

Simple Task Manager app for android written in Kotlin using Android Studio and Jetpack Compose. Users can add tasks and mark them as completed via a check/uncheck button, and delete completed tasks. Persists task data in a local database using the Room library.

My purpose in creating this app was to learn about native Android development and understand the basics before moving into more complicated mobile development projects.
